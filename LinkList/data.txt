We have finally found something that doesn't have a cause, because there was no time for a cause to exist in.
For me, this means there is no possibility of a creator because there is no time for a creator to have existed.
Since time itself began at the moment of the Big Bang, it was an event that could not have been caused or created by anyone or anything.
So, science has given us the answer we set out to discover, an answer that took more than 3,000 years of human endeavor.
We have discovered how the laws of nature, acting on the mass and energy of the Universe, started a process that would eventually produce us, sitting here on our planet pretty pleased at having worked it all out.
So, when people ask me if a God created the Universe, I tell them that the question itself makes no sense.
Time didn't exist before the Big Bang, so there is no time for God to make the Universe in.
It's like asking for directions to the edge of the Earth. The Earth is a sphere.
It doesn't have an edge, so looking for it is a futile exercise.
We are each free to believe what we want, and it's my view that the simplest explanation is there is no God.
No one created the Universe, and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization.
There is probably no heaven and no afterlife, either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the Universe.
And for that, I extremely grateful.
